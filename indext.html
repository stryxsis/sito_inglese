      <h3 class="big-text">What is the Netiquette?</h3>
      <p class="normal-text">Netiquette is a word that combines the English word network and the French word 
        étiquette (good manners). It is a set of informal rules that regulate the good education
        of a user on the Internet web, especially in relating to other users through 
        resources such as newsgroups, mailing lists, forums, blogs, social networks or 
        email in general Respect for netiquette is not required by any law, but under a 
        legal aspect, netiquette is often referred to in cntracts for the supply of online 
        services.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="bg-cover__text reveal">

      <p class="tw">
        The violation of the netiquette involves a general approval by the other users of the Network,<br>
        followed by an isolation of the "rude" subject and sometimes by the request for suspension of some services used to carry out acts contrary to it<br>(usually the email).<br>
        In cases of serious and continuous violations,<br>the rude user is punishable by a ban.<br>
        They are attitudes contrary to netiquette,<br>
        and sometimes sanctioned by abuse desks: 
        <br>sending spam, carrying out mailbombing and excessive cross-posting and / or multi-posting on Usenet newsgroups. 
        <br>Sending emails without a subject is also considered disrespectful towards the recipient.</p>

      <h4 class="big-text">Proper way to be have, forms required in social or official life:</h4>
      <h3 class="med-text mt-1">1. Remember the human:</h3>
      <p>
        • Golden Rule<br>
        • All you see is a computer screen<br>
        • Easy to misinterpret your meanings<br>
        • Would you say it to a person's face?<br>
        • Written words can be stored<br>
        (When using a computer to communicate remember to see beyond the machine.<br>
        You are speaking with a real person with feelings.
        You must treat them with respect and dignity).</p>

      <h3 class="med-text mt-2">3. Choose your contacts purposefully</h3>
      <p>
        Know where you are in cyberspace<br>
        • Netiquette varies from domain to domain<br>
        • Lurk before you leap<br>
        (Do not participate in groups or conversations with people who you do not know or who are acting inappropriately.
        Your user ID can often be tracked directly back to your social networking page or other applications).</p>

      <h3 class="med-text mt-2">5. Show your intelligence in your interactions</h3>
      <p >Make yourself look good online<br>
        • Judged by quality of writing<br>
        • Know what you're talking about and make sense<br>
        • Don't posts flame-bait<br>
        • Your networking pages could be archived<br>
        (Try not to make spelling errors on accident or on purpose.<br>
        Many people will judge you poorly for seemingly ignorant writing).</p>
        
        <h3 class="med-text mt-2">7. Do not participate in flame wars:</h3>
        <p >Help keep flame wars under control<br>
          • "Flaming" - what people do when they express a strongly held opinion without holding back any emotion.
          (This is when people use bad language and insults when communicating on the internet.
          Stop engaging that person and flag their post).</p>

        <h3 class="med-text mt-2">9. Don‘t abuse your power:</h3>
        <p>Admin moderators have more rights than other users and<br>they should value the use of those rights.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col reveal">

      <h4 class="med-text mt-3">2. The same rules as real life:</h4>
      <p>
        Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.<br>
        • Be ethical<br>
        • Breaking the law is bad netiquette<br>
        (Your behavior on the Internet should be as good or better than your behavior in real life.
        You are not anonymous on the Internet).
      </p>

      <h3 class="med-text mt-3">4. Respect others' time and bandwidth:</h3>
        <p>
          Respect other people's time and bandwidth<br>
          • You're not the center of cyberspace<br>
          • Rules for discussion groups<br>
          • To whom should messages be directed?<br>
          (Do not post messages that waste peoples time.
          It takes time to read what you say, so make sure that it is worth reading.
          Also do not expect immediate responses from others.
          It may take time).</p>
      
      <h3 class="med-text mt-3">6. Share your knowledge</h3>
      <p >Share expert knowledge<br>
        • Strength of cyberspace is in its numbers<br>
        • Share results of your questions with others<br>
        (The Internet is a place where people can easily share.
        Be kind and helpful when responding to others and do your best to help.
        The sum total of a few good pieces of information can make for a much better understanding).</p>
        
        <h3 class="med-text mt-3">8. Respect other people's privacy:</h3>
        <p>Never try to read friends private messages or discover their password information.
          Just like real mail, our email and other messages are private.</p>
        
          <h3 class="med-text mt-3">10. Be forgiving of other people‘s mistakes:</h3>
        <p>
          All we were new or another and we all make mistakes at times. Don't be concerned when you see someone make a typo, use the wrong word, ask a cheap question or write an unnecessarily long rant. If you really want to give advice, it's best to offer it privately by email.
